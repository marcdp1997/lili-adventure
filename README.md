Welcome to Lili's Adventure!

v0.5
Here you can move through different areas, look at the direction you want, open / close doors, pick / drop items, 
put items into others and get them, equip items, unequip items and turn on a gps. Tutorial implemented.  

v1.0
Now there are enemies that move freely and randomly trough all the areas! Be sure to equip the best items in the three different slots available (shield, weapon and clothes). Items have different characteristics, for example: the hood makes you invisible and inmune to enemies attacks, the potion adds 5 to your HP, the shield reduces the damage received, the sword increases your attack, and so on. Also you have HP and coins to spend in the items that a merchant located in lookout area has. Sell items or kill enemies to earn coins.
Play to discover all the new features!
